# Proportional Loading

The scripts in this repo were used for the simulation and analysis of data in the paper **Don’t go chasing artificial waterfalls:  Artificial line-limits and cascading failures in power grids**. The preprint of this paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12848)

To run this code download or clone the repo as well as the [Power Grid Networking](https://github.com/JonnoB/PowerGridNetworking) R package and [these](https://github.com/JonnoB/Useful_PhD__R_Functions) additional functions.

**N.B** Note that the core dataset of this paper is not publicly available. please use either your own dataset or [Electricity Ten Year Statement (ETYS)](https://www.nationalgrideso.com/insights/electricity-ten-year-statement-etys) or [IEEE](https://icseg.iti.illinois.edu/power-cases/) example datasets. This will involve a bit of wrangling.

The results of this script also form a chapter of my PhD.

Please use the master version of PowerGridNewtworking from 24-10-19 or earlier. Later versions may not work correctly or as expected.
